# AiesecTask
hello Aiesec , 
I was really interested to do the task but once I read it I found that I have never used those technologie , I know them all , but working with them not , specially the API . I have sent you a question about it but I haven't received any answer. I want to make clear the technologies I am using: so I use PHP (+HTML,CSS)  for web and python, C# for desktop . These technlogies If I can have any task I can do it that why I am asking you if you are using it. Besides this, as a developer I can easily learn new programming languages, new technologies so I would be grateful to start with what I am best at and at the same time learning the techs you want me to work with them.
Since I have to deliver the task , I will share with a project I am working on with PHP(+HTML) and My SQL as a Data Base.
* The project will be hosted as soon as possible and it's for a teacher who wants to have a platform where he can share with his students theirs grades and remarks online so that he dosen't need every time to say his remarks or to say the grades in public, also he wants to share some series of exercices and corrections. That all what I could do . 
All you have to do is to download my project file called : " ProjectProfPC " and you will find all the source code
I hope you can accept this task ! 
Thank you
